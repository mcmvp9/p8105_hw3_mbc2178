```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Let's load in the libraries needed to perform data manipulation and cleaning for this assignment.
```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
```

## Problem 1 

Let's load the `instacart` data from the `p8105.datasets` using the following:
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart") 
```

The `instacart` dataset contains `r nrow(instacart)` observation 
and `r ncol(instacart)` variables. The variables that exist in this dataset include 
`r ls(instacart)`.
