Let’s load in the libraries needed to perform data manipulation and
cleaning for this assignment.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

## Problem 1

Let’s load the `instacart` data from the `p8105.datasets` using the
following:

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart") 
```

The `instacart` dataset contains 1384617 observation and 15 variables.
The variables that exist in this dataset include add_to_cart_order,
aisle, aisle_id, days_since_prior_order, department, department_id,
eval_set, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, order_id, order_number,
product_id, product_name, reordered, user_id.
